I learnt how to suck a long time ago. That feeling of inadequacy that comes from being in a room of people wiser/smarter/more creative than me just inspires me to meet their high standards. Spending weeks working on a project, only to be beaten to the punch by a more organised rival, inspires me to up my game.

I wouldn't be where I am if I didn't suck. A sense of entitlement is for spoilt rich kids, who are still spending Daddy's money - I can't afford such a luxury.

Get out there, suck, and get better.
