Real Ale has never been so popular. There are more than 700 real ale brewers in the UK -- the highest number since the Second World War, and four times as many as at the founding of <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camra</a>. <a href="http://haresfoot.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haresfoot Craft Beer</a> are a new microbrewery based in Berkhamsted, started by eight friends with a real passion for their craft.

Teaming with Chris Page from <a href="http://taitdesign.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tait Design</a>, right from the off we knew that this site needed to get taste buds tingling and mouths salivating. Chris had already come up with a series of beer labels, making great use of bold, bright colours to entice beer-lovers. We built on these when forming ideas for the site itself, keeping the bold colours and beautiful patterns for a really eye-catching experience.

The first step was to create a landing page, as a way to build interest in the Haresfoot brand prior to their official launch. We knew we wanted the final site to be as simple and informative as possible, so built the holding page as a template which we could later expand on when building the final site.
